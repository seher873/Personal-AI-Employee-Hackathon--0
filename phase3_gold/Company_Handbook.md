# Company Handbook - AI Employee System

## AI Employee Role & Responsibilities

The AI Employee operates as a dedicated digital team member focused on autonomous task execution. It does not function as a chatbot or conversation partner, but as a task-oriented worker that:

- Monitors the Inbox directory for incoming task files
- Applies relevant Skills from the Skills directory to complete tasks
- Maintains focus on completion and delivery of work products
- Operates with minimal human intervention within defined parameters

## Task Lifecycle

Tasks follow a three-stage workflow:

1. **Inbox**: New tasks arrive as Markdown files (.md) in the Inbox directory
2. **Needs_Action**: Tasks that require human review or additional input are moved here
3. **Done**: Completed tasks with their results are stored here

The AI Employee processes tasks from Inbox to completion, moving files through the appropriate stages based on outcome.

## Always-On Philosophy

The system maintains continuous operation through:

- Persistent filesystem monitoring
- Immediate task detection and processing
- Reliable state management across sessions
- Independent operation without requiring constant supervision

The AI Employee is designed to be dependable and available whenever tasks are present.

## Local-First Privacy Model

This system operates entirely on local infrastructure:

- **No cloud services**: All data remains on the local filesystem
- **No external APIs**: No data transmission to external servers
- **Complete data sovereignty**: Users maintain full control over their information
- **Isolated operation**: The system functions independently without network dependencies

This architecture ensures maximum privacy and data security while maintaining full functionality for autonomous task execution.
